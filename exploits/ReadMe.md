# Exploits
These are proof of concept exploits for the BeagleBone.

## Default Port 80: Webserver
- Port 80 runs a web service *as root* with bonescript.
- Bonescript is a useful piece of JavaScript that runs client side and communicates using socket.io with the bone.
- Bonescript contains two functions that can easily be used for an exploit:
	- digitalWrite(pin, value, [callback])
	- writeTextFile(filename, data, [callback])

The idea here is that if this service is exposed it is trivial to gain root on this device. This is accomplished by accessing the device over Port 80, executing [webservice.js](webservice.js) on the device to modify any file on the system, and taking advantage of the changes made.

Examples of files that could be exploited:
- /etc/passwd
- /etc/shadow
- /etc/ssh/authorized-keys/%u
- /etc/ssh/sshd-config

From this setup you can install keys, change passwords, or leak passwords and gain root. From there you can do whatever else you need.
