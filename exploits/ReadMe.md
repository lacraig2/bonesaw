# Exploits
These are proof of concept exploits for the BeagleBone.

## Default Port 22: SSH
- Port 22 runs SSH. Many, many, many beaglebones run with either the default password or no password.
These are the configurations checked:
- root/''
- root/'temppwd'
- debian/''
- debian/'temppwd'


## Default Port 80: Webserver
- Port 80 runs a web service *as root* with bonescript.
- Bonescript is a useful piece of JavaScript that runs client side and communicates using socket.io with the bone.
- Bonescript contains two functions that can easily be used for an exploit:
	- digitalWrite(pin, value, [callback])
	- writeTextFile(filename, data, [callback])

The idea here is that if this service is exposed it is trivial to gain root on this device. This is accomplished by accessing the device over Port 80, executing [webservice.js](webservice.js) on the device to modify any file on the system, and taking advantage of the changes made.

Examples of files that could be exploited:
- /etc/passwd
- /etc/shadow
- /etc/ssh/authorized-keys/%u
- /etc/ssh/sshd-config

From this setup you can install keys, change passwords, or leak passwords and gain root.

## Default Port 3000: Cloud9
- Here we check to see if Cloud9 is running on the bone. If so, it alerts the user. The fact that this is on port 3000 typically means you can use the terminal in Cloud9 for at least user level priviledges. This could quite reasonably set up a system for password cracking, priviledge escalation, or basic botnet behavior.
